The sales data was initially received in an Excel file format. To facilitate analysis, the data was imported into an SQL server. This step allowed for efficient querying and manipulation of the data to extract meaningful insights.

## SQL Analysis

Once the data was imported into the SQL server, various queries were executed to analyze different aspects of the business performance. These queries included calculations for total revenue, average spending per customer, identification of best-selling pizzas, and identification of pizzas with poor sales performance.

## PowerBI Visualization

To make the analysis results more accessible and visually appealing, the project was finalized in PowerBI. PowerBI provided powerful visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports. This allowed stakeholders to easily explore the data and gain valuable insights into the business performance.
